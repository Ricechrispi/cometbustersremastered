		read and use: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.Sprite
		"kill" method for movables
		hitbox interaction
		commet spawing comets (almost done)
		figure out sound
		points
		respawn
		life tracking
		enemy ship complete (spawend by level/game manager)
		smiley complete
		comet complete
		levels complete
		special abilities: disruptor, shield, hyperspace, (none)
		MENUE!!!!!
		multiplayer: loading/changeing input, maybe fix it at first
