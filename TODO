BIG TODOS:
		figure out size of medium small comets, small one range from 16x16 to 20x20 (one with 20x18????) currently 21x21, way too big
		read and use: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.Sprite
		"kill" method for movables
		hitbox interaction: comet&ship, comet&alien, comet&alien_bullet, ship&alien, ship&alien_bullet, ship&smiley, alien&smiley, alien_bullet&smiley
		commet spawing comets (determine correct speed vectors...)
		figure out sound
		points
		respawn  (life losing animation, check for game end, etc)
		enemy ship complete (spawend by level/game manager)
		smiley complete
		comet complete
		levels complete
		special abilities: disruptor, shield, hyperspace, (none)
		MENUE!!!!!
		multiplayer: loading/changeing input
		generate/draw stars!
		make settings/player config a dictionary, is easier to read..
